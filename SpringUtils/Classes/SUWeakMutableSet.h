/** A set which does not hold strong references to its members and automatically removes them when they are deallocated.
 *
 *  Objects may be freely added or removed from the set from any queue. Objects which are added to the set may be freely
 *  retained or released from any queue.
 *
 *  To access the set contents, use the `set` property. This property returns a copy of the set which _will_ retain its members,
 *  ensuring that the set remains immutable and its members refrain from deallocating while it is in scope.
 *
 *  __Important:__ Toll-free-bridged types such as NSString, NSNumber, NSArray, NSDictionary and NSSet cannot be
 *  added to this set. An exception will be raised you attempt to insert a bridged object in to the set.
